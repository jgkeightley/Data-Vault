# Models of Care for Shoulder Pain in Spinal Cord Injury: A Scoping Review

## Introduction
Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a neurological condition that typically causes significant disability. Secondary health conditions (SHCs) are experienced by a large proportion of the SCI population, with individuals with long-term SCI developing an average of 4 SHCs per year[^1], with shoulder pain being one of the most common and disabling[^2][^3][^4].

Delivering optimal health outcomes to individuals with SCI and shoulder pain requires a well organised, multidisciplinary approach, considered in a biopsychosocial framework[^5][^6]. To our knowledge, no summative literature exists to underpin every component of this approach, although attempts have been made to summarise the evidence for management[^7].

To asssist in the development of high quality literature to inform this multidisciplinary approach, a thorough mapping of the available literature would be beneficial. Scoping reviews are the recommended methodology to map evidence and identify gaps in heterogeneous bodies of literature[^8][^9][^10].

## Objective
The aim of this scoping review was to examine and categorise the published literature that attempts to inform clinical practice as it relates broadly to the management and diagnosis of shoulder pain in SCI. Additionally, we aimed to identify gaps in the literature as they relate to how research is conducted, measured, and reported.

When synthesising our results, we aimed for them to be accessible and digestible, so we have published this [[ü™® Obsidian|Obsidian Vault]] as a means to achieve this.
